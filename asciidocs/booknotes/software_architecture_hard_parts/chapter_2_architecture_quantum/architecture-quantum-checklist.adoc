= Architecture Quantum & Coupling Review Checklist
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

:sectnums:

Use this checklist during *architecture reviews, refactors, or before splitting into microservices*.
Unclear answers are signals — not failures.

== System Context

* *System Name:* 
* *Review Date:* 
* *Team(s):* 
* *Reviewer(s):* 
* *Current Architecture:* (Monolith / Modular Monolith / Microservices)

== 1. Architecture Quantum Assessment
_What must move together?_

For each capability (A, B, C…), answer YES or NO.

=== Deployment
* [ ] Can this capability be deployed independently?
* [ ] Can it be rolled back independently?

=== Data
* [ ] Does it own its data exclusively?
* [ ] Can its schema evolve without coordination?

=== Runtime
* [ ] Can it fail without taking others down?
* [ ] Can it scale independently?

[IMPORTANT]
====
If *any* answer above is NO, the components belong to the *same architecture quantum*.
====

== 2. Quantum of Coupling Analysis
_Why are components forced together?_

Check all that apply:

* [ ] Shared database or schema
* [ ] Cross-module transactions
* [ ] In-process method calls
* [ ] Unversioned APIs
* [ ] Implicit data contracts
* [ ] Shared CI/CD pipeline
* [ ] Shared configuration or secrets

*Dominant coupling causes / notes:*

== 3. Instability Placement Check
_Is change pressure in the right place?_

[cols="1,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Module | Depends On (Ce) | Depended By (Ca) | Changes Often? | Instability Placement OK?
| UI |  |  |  | 
| Core Domain |  |  |  | 
| Application Layer |  |  |  | 
| Infrastructure |  |  |  | 
|===

[WARNING]
====
High *instability* combined with high *afferent coupling* is a strong design smell.
====

== 4. UI / Edge Layer Sanity Check
_Is volatility leaking inward?_

* [ ] UI contains business rules
* [ ] Backend refactors frequently break UI
* [ ] UI changes force backend redeploys

If any are checked, coupling direction may be inverted.

== 5. Release & Coordination Friction
_Where does it hurt today?_

* [ ] Releases require cross-team coordination
* [ ] Unrelated changes block each other
* [ ] Rollbacks are system-wide and risky
* [ ] Teams wait on schema or contract changes

*Concrete examples of friction:*

== 6. Quantum Split Justification
_Only consider a split if ALL are true:_

* [ ] Independent rate of change exists
* [ ] Coordination cost is recurring and measurable
* [ ] Clear ownership boundary exists
* [ ] Data ownership can be enforced
* [ ] Stable contract can be defined

[CAUTION]
====
If any item above is unchecked, *do not split the quantum yet*.
====

== 7. Microservices Reality Check
_Avoid distributed monoliths._

* [ ] No shared database
* [ ] Explicit, versioned APIs
* [ ] Backward compatibility strategy
* [ ] Observability (logs, metrics, tracing)
* [ ] Failure isolation

== 8. Team Alignment
_Does architecture match communication?_

* [ ] Each quantum maps to a team
* [ ] Teams can deploy without coordination
* [ ] Cognitive load is manageable

== 9. Decision Summary

* *Current number of architecture quanta:* 
* *Recommended action:* (Keep as-is / Reduce coupling / Split quantum)
* *Primary reason:*

Golden Rule: Split quanta only when *coordination cost exceeds operational cost*.
